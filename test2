The provided contexts do not directly address the task of calculating the square of a planet's distance. However, they do offer insights into programming and calculating squares. Here's a coherent answer based on the given contexts:

To calculate the square of a planet's distance, you would need to write a program that takes the distance as an input and returns the square of that distance. The programming languages mentioned in the provided contexts are C and Python. Here's a simple example in each language:

C Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double distance, square;
    printf("Enter the distance: ");
    scanf("%lf", &distance);
    square = distance * distance;
    printf("The square of the distance is: %.2lf\n", square);
    return 0;
}
```
In the above C program, the user is prompted to enter a distance value, which is then squared and printed as output.

Python Program:
```python
def square_distance(distance):
    return distance * distance

distance = float(input("Enter the distance: "))
square = square_distance(distance)
print("The square of the distance is:", square)
```
In the Python program, the user is also prompted to enter a distance value. The `square_distance` function is defined to calculate the square of the distance, and the result is printed as output.

Remember that these are simplified examples and may not be suitable for calculating the square of a planet's distance, as the actual distance may be too large to fit into a standard data type. However, these examples should give you a basic understanding of how to write a program to calculate the square of a given number.
